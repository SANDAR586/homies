# 📡 Android Peer-to-Peer Chat App (Wi-Fi Direct + Sockets)

A lightweight Android chat application built from scratch using **Wi-Fi Direct** and **socket programming**, enabling two Android devices to connect and exchange messages **without internet access**. This project demonstrates a deeper understanding of Android’s networking APIs and system-level components beyond typical UI-focused development.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔌 Peer-to-peer connection using **Wi-Fi Direct** (`WifiP2pManager`)
- 📬 Real-time **message exchange over sockets**
- 🧠 Custom **host-client negotiation** logic
- ⚙️ Background thread management for **socket I/O**
- 📶 Works entirely **offline**, no server or internet required
- 🛠️ Minimal UI — focused on system-level networking

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

> “I wanted to go beyond building traditional UI apps and dive deeper into how Android manages peer-to-peer networking and sockets at the system level.”

This project shows:
- A solid grasp of **low-level networking**
- Experience working with **Android OS internals**
- Manual handling of connection states, socket lifecycle, and device roles
- Real-world use of **asynchronous communication** and multithreading
